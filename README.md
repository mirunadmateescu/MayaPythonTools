## SmartBridge_workingV001.py
Got some help with the maths behind finding the relevant groups of verts on a side so I've been finally able get a prototype out for this one. Will bridge between two sets of edges that don't match in numbers, the further away the first vertex is from the last in an edge selection the better, but will work in organic surfaces. For long distances it works better to get it done in a few smaller bits rather than bridging it all at once.
